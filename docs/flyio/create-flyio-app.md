## Create Flyio App

Make sure you've installed [flyctl](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/install/) before running this step

```sh
fly launch
```

You'll see following prompt, please enter "y" to copy the config:

```sh
An existing fly.toml file was found for app punitd-modal-comfyui-deploy
? Would you like to copy its configuration to the new app? (y/N)
```

You'll now see one more prompt confirming to deploy directly or launching a new app, please enter "y" as you'll be creating a new app
in this case

```sh
Scanning source code
Detected a Remix app
App 'punitd-modal-comfyui-deploy' already exists. You can deploy to it with `fly deploy`.
? Continue launching a new app?  (y/N)
```

You'll now see following prompt(final one) asking you whether you want to tweak app settings. Please select "y" to change config like name and region based on your choice

```sh
Creating app in /Users/punitdama/Personal/AI/modal-comfyui-deploy-app/web
